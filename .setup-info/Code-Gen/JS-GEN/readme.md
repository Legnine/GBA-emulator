# Place a File named "filenames.txt" in the folder named "file"

## Now there are a few components you may have to change.

Please change the variable "gameType" in Cat.py to the name of the folder in your gba-host folder that corresponds with the type of games you would like to generate code for. (Default is gba-alt)


Place your files in the "file" folder, and make sure they are named the same as the names in the "filenames.txt" file. Make sure there are no spaces in the file names, and that they have no ' or % or other weird characters not found in ours, then place your file in the "file" folder.

Run the python file, copy all the text in a generated file called "gen.txt" and then delete the last line (it will be a blank line).

Paste it all in the file you would like and your done!
